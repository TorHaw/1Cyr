## üìö Data Structures

### Stacks
- The best data structure for a stack in Java is `ArrayDeque`, which implements the `Deque` interface.
- It is more efficient than the legacy `java.util.Stack` class because it is not synchronized.
- The key methods are `push()` to add an element and `pop()` to remove one.
- To "override" a value, you must `pop()` the top element and then `push()` the new one.

### Queues
- The best class for a queue is also `ArrayDeque`, which adheres to the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle.
- It offers constant time, $O(1)$, performance for `offer()` (add) and `poll()` (remove) operations.
- `LinkedList` is a viable alternative but may have higher memory overhead.
- `PriorityQueue` should be used when elements need to be processed based on their priority.

## üíª Core Java Concepts

### Java Class Files
- A Java source file must be named exactly the same as its `public` class, with a `.java` extension.
- The file should contain `package` and `import` declarations at the top.
- The `main` method (`public static void main(String[] args)`) is the entry point for execution.

### Constructors
- A **constructor** is a special method used to initialize an object. It has the same name as the class and no return type.
- It is automatically called when a new object is created with the `new` keyword.
- A **default constructor** is provided by the compiler if none is defined. A **parameterized constructor** allows for custom initialization.

### String Manipulation
- **Concatenation**: Strings can be combined using the `+` operator or the `concat()` method.
- **`StringBuilder`**: The most efficient class for modifying or building strings, especially in loops, because it is mutable. Use `StringBuilder` for single-threaded applications.
- **`StringBuffer`**: A thread-safe, synchronized version of `StringBuilder` for multi-threaded use.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Errors and Solutions

### `NullPointerException`
- This error occurs when a program tries to use a variable that has not been initialized (i.e., it is `null`).
- The stack trace will point to the exact line number where the error occurred.
- **Fix**: Initialize your objects before using them or add `null` checks (`if (myObject != null)`).

### `error: Class names, 'some_file.txt', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested`
- This error means you are trying to compile a file that does not have a `.java` extension.
- **Fix**: Ensure your file is named with the `.java` extension and that your `javac` command points to the correct file name.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Getting User Input
- Use the **`Scanner`** class from `java.util.Scanner`.
- Create a `Scanner` object with `new Scanner(System.in)`.
- Use methods like `nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, and `nextDouble()` to read different data types.
- Always call `scanner.close()` to release system resources when you are finished.
