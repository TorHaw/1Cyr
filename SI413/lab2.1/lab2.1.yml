#### TASK 5 ####

semantics: |
    Print takes an expression and prints it to the terminal

    Within a string literal, ordinary characters are interpreted as
    themselves, and escape sequences are interpreted as the character
    after the underscore.

    Concatenate takes two string expressions and combines them in left-to-right
    order.

    Reversal takes an expression, reverses it, and
    then returns the reversed string.

    Input reads a line of text from the terminal and returns it.

    Assign string takes a String expression to the left and assigns it to a variable
    name listed to the right.

    Assign bool takes a boolean expression to the left and assigns it to a variable
    name listed to the right.

    contains string takes two string expressions and compares them by checking if the second string
    expression exists in the first (when reading left to right).

    Less and greater takes two string expressions to the left and compares them left to right.

    Not takes a single boolean expression to the left and return the opposite of it. 

    And and Or takes two boolean expressions to the left and returns the assosciated boolean 
    expression from an And or Or statement on the two values.

    Language idea seems quite radical. I like the surfer theme. Still needs quite a bit of work to finish off the parts, but this is
    is definitely a good start. Keep it up!
